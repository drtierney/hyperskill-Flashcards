**Stage #1 Stage one, card one**
Display information about a single card on the screen.

**Stage #2 What's on the card?**
Compare the lines and work with conditions: display the card and the userâ€™s answer on the screen.

**Stage #3 Make it your own**
Practice arrays and loops: create a new card for the program to play with you.

**Stage #4 A good stack**
Learn to use hashtables, display key values and work with exceptions in order to fix the problem of repeating cards.

**Stage #5 Menu, please!**
Work with files: create a menu that allows to add, delete, save and upload saved cards in your game.

**Stage #6 Statistics**
Using statistics, set a correct answer for each card and teach the game to determine which card was the hardest to solve.

**Stage 7 IMPORTant**
Enable the user to import files right upon starting the game, working with command-line arguments.
